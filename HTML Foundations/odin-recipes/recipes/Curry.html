    <ol>
        <li>Add the frozen vegetables and broth to a soup pot (it's okay if the broth does not fully cover the vegetables). Place a lid on top and turn the heat on to high. Bring the broth up to a boil. </li>
        <li>Give the vegetables a good stir, turn the heat down to low, then add the coconut milk, curry powder, and ginger. Stir to combine, then let simmer for just a few more minutes. </li>
        <li>Taste the broth and add salt and pepper to your liking.  </li>
        <li>Serve hot with bread or rice. </li>
    </ol>
